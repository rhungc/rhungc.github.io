## Welcome to my Personal Webpage 

My name is Ruei-Hung (Ray) Chen, I am currently a fourth-year student at University of Toronto studying Applied Mathematics in Finance and Statistics. I’m particularly interested in using data analytic to solve problems and derive insights from large datasets. I’m currently taking courses on Mathematical Theory of Finance, Data Visualization, Methods of Data Analysis and Financial Risk Management. I’m looking forward to utilize my technical skills in data analysis and risk management to solve difficult problems. Feel free to contact me by email: ray1999chen@gmail.com or by phone: (647)978-1846.

### Past Projects

#### Data Visulization Project-1 
In this project, I used R programming language to visualize the data on Hollywood movies made in Toronto Canada. I focused on the relationship between currency rate between CAD and USD from 1990 to 2020 and the number of movies made thoroughout the same period. I design the visulization using a bar gragh representing the count of the movies made overlay with a line graph of the exchange rate between the two currencies. In addition, I used binary colour hues to distinguish the years United States experience recessions.
