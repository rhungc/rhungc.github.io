Hi ! My name is Ruei-Hung (Ray) Chen, 

I recently just graduated from the University of Toronto studying Applied Mathematics in Finance and Statistics. I’m particularly interested in using data analytic to solve difficult problems and derive insights from large datasets to exploit investment oppertunities. Currently, I am actively looking for a full time job and is hoping to work at an innovative environment that can challenge my problem solving and creative thinking every single day!

### Past Projects

#### Data Driven Article - Daily CO<sub>2</sub> Emission from Transportation.
As a final project to a data visualization course, me along with 3 other teammates worked cohesively to disign and implemented a data driven article with topic related to "Daily CO<sub>2</sub> Emission from Transportation". Within this article, our team successfully adapted the ShinyApp Library in R and used it to design several interactive activities. The project aimed to educate the readers with statistical facts about the CO<sub>2</sub> emission around the world and show them visually what can be done in their daily life to reduce their CO<sub>2</sub> contribution to the world. 

To access the article, see [Data Driven Article](https://github.com/Andrew-Chew/STA313W21-Project.git)

#### Data Visulization Project-2 (Bike Theft) 
In this project, my project partner, Zhenyu Xuan, and I explore the bicycle theft data provided by Toronto Police Service. We created a data driven article that visualize some of the interesting statsitcs from this dataset and import additional geographical data to help us understand the data better. Link to the data: [](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bicycle-thefts/)

In our project, we take advantage of the location attributes from the dataset and plot the thefts on the map. The visualization of geo-spatial data make it very clear to see the density of the theft in GTA neighberhoods. Furthermore, we import other interesting datasets such as bicycle routes and bicycle parking lots in Toronto. We try to see if there's any relationship between those locations and bicycle theft density.
