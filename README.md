Hi ! My name is Ruei-Hung (Ray) Chen, 

I recently just graduated from the University of Toronto studying Applied Mathematics in Finance and Statistics. I’m particularly interested in using data analytic to solve difficult problems and derive insights from large datasets to exploit investment oppertunities. Currently, I am actively looking for a full time job and is hoping to work at an innovative environment that can challenge my problem solving and creative thinking every single day!

### Past Projects

#### Data Driven Article - Daily CO<sub>2</sub> Emission from Transportation.
As a final project to a data visualization course, me along with 3 other teammates worked cohesively to disign and implemented a data driven article with topic related to "Daily CO<sub>2</sub> Emission from Transportation". Within this article, our team successfully adapted the ShinyApp Library in R and used it to design several interactive activities. The project aimed to educate the readers with statistical facts about the CO<sub>2</sub> emission around the world and show them visually what can be done in their daily life to reduce their CO<sub>2</sub> contribution to the world. 

To access the article, see [Data Driven Article](https://github.com/Andrew-Chew/STA313W21-Project.git)

#### Yield Curve Construction Project (APM466)  
In this project, I collected over 30 Candian government bonds, each with different time to maturity. By collecting the closing price data of those government bonds for over a month, I was able to calculate yield to maturity, spot rate and future rate of each bond. Using these information, I constructed yield curves using bootstrapping and interpolation techniques. The project demonstrate my understanding to general fixed income securities and showcase my technical skills to construct yield curves out of real time bond information.
